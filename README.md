# Multi-filter
this project is all about the searching pattern we can use for searching data from db using charecters which is similar to the data in db 
Eg. API: www.ab.com?search=”xyz” Here the xyz string should be searched through name, email, address, mobile and salary.
For these task i used native query to create a search pattern using %like% operator.
There is one more implementation for the multiple filter by which we can search specific data which matches with given parameter 
like dpeartemt_id,branch_id,designation_id when providing these fileds can fetch the matching data 
can give multiple parameter for per field
